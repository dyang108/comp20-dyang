### Semester update: April 24, 2016
<hr>
This repository contains a collection of work that I have completed in Comp 20: Web Programming, at Tufts University.

For me, I enjoyed the Semester Group project the most out of the assignments,since I was able to apply what I had learned throughout the semester to a creative project, working on a team towards a common goal. I think one of the biggest elements in web programming is the creative element, and I got to express that through the group project.

I feel I have grown a significant amount since the beginning of this course. I had had some experience building websites in the past, but I haven't had the opportunity to piece the puzzle together, as I have done throughout this class. Furthermore, learning about databases and server-side development was one of my primary goals this semester, and I think that I have gained a firmer grasp upon server-side development through this class.

Probably the single most important skill that I have acquired through this course is the ability to read documentation and understand it. While completing my homeworks and labs, I stumbled across a number of obstacles, all of which could be solved with a simple Google search and an understanding of simple code documentation. For example, when implementing MongoDB in our semester group project, we needed to understand different database commands and how they are used in NodeJS. With [documentation](https://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/drivers/node-js/) on how to use MongoDB with Node, we were able to complete our database.

Another one of the most important things I have learned in this class is the way the web works, and how servers "talk" to clients via HTTP. I feel that this is essential to understand when developing code for the web. Before taking this class, I had only worked on client-side websites, generally with little user interaction. I have since learned to build websites with servers that can query other sites. This means that my websites have more flexibility. For example, when I built the API for Tufts menus, I had to generate JSON objects server-side to store in a database and return. Building the application routes required a knowledge of HTTP and communication on the web.

I'm going to add one more thing that I've learned, which I think is immensely important. I have learned to deploy code that I have built privately to the web so that people can actually see my projects. Not only is this cool, but it is also one of the most practical things I have learned through my career as a CS major at Tufts.

I would like to spend some more time learning about front-end frameworks and automatically updating dynamic web pages. I would also like to spend some time learning about a variety of different server-side web frameworks and SQL-based databases, so that I am not limited to just the JavaScript stack. Finally, I'd like to learn to deploy sites without Heroku.
