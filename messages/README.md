Question: Is it possible to request data from a different origin, or from your local machine using XMLHttpRequest?

No. In the case of requesting data from a different origin, it is not possible 
because JavaScript is designed to prevent malicious websites from accessing 
HTML DOM data from another website that the user is browsing. In the case of 
accessing data from the filesystem, XMLHttpRequest also does not allow access. 
This is because JavaScript from a website should not be able to load files on 
the private computer of a user.
